The above chart is the ranking of the most used web technologies provided by Stack Overflow in 2023.

React was adopted as the e-government framework standard and remains the most popular framework in 2024.

## Reasons Developers Prefer React

### 1. Explicit State Changes

React only supports one-way binding.

Data flows in one direction only. (Angular supports two-way binding.)

As scale increases, one-way binding, which makes it easier to track state changes, is advantageous.

```jsx
	function App {
		const [name, setName] = useState('')
	// The reason name changes is only when setName is called, so if name changes, you only need to look at the setName logic.
		function onChange(e){
			setName(e.target.value)
		}

		return <input value={name} onChange={onChange}/>
	}
```

### 2. JSX (JavaScript XML)

This is React-specific syntax that combines HTML with JavaScript syntax.

```jsx
{
  condition ? <div>Renders only when condition is true.</div> : null;
}
```

### 3. Low Learning Curve

The syntax is concise, making it good for beginners. (Performance optimization is difficult.)

### 4. Strong Community and Meta Support

React started as a UI library and was designed to allow free expansion of the rest.

The community grew and various libraries were created.

Since Meta is the main sponsor, continuous development is guaranteed.

## History of React

### 2010 React Release

At the time in 2010, the web development method was to generate HTML on the server and provide it to the client.

The server dynamically generated content, and the browser downloaded and rendered it.

JavaScript only played a supplementary role like form handling.

#### Browser Role Expansion

Browsers began to support various features such as jQuery, local storage, WebSocket, Canvas, SVG, Geolocation, etc.

As DOM interaction and client data loading features like Ajax were added, JavaScript became complex.

Frameworks like AngularJS and Backbone.js emerged.

These are systematized with MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) patterns.

#### Facebook's Challenge

Facebook achieved great success and needed to reduce browser burden.

The challenge was to reduce JavaScript bundle size to reduce download, parsing, and execution burden.

The above is a Facebook page from 2011.

Many features are included on one page.

Receiving the entire page from the server every time data changes would be a huge burden on the browser.

With many elements that change data in real-time, refreshing the entire page would have had the worst UX.

##### Spartan Project

It was promoted to create a Facebook for Safari (web) in response to Apple's app regulations.

HTML5-based hybrid apps could not replace native apps with the technology at the time.

The original purpose failed, but it is being revived in forms like Flutter and React Native.

##### Emergence of BoltJS

It was created by Facebook but was not used in practice.

It developed into a new version oriented toward functional programming, becoming the origin of React.

It developed into a one-way method where the view changes when the model changes.

It proposed a method of discarding the previous DOM and newly rendering when the view changes.

The React project started with this proposal.

#### React Release

Creating the `UFI` above was React's first project.

Various features such as share, like, and comments were needed.

JSX and the Flux pattern emerged here.

After acquiring Instagram, the Instagram web version was also made with React.

It was released as open source at JSConf US.

#### Skeptical Views

There were negative opinions about JSX syntax where HTML and JavaScript are mixed.

The logic was that it violated the separation of concerns principle.

However, this was a misunderstanding since React separates concerns based on components.

#### Companies' Choices

The performance benefits of component-based reuse and partial rendering became known.

A community was created and libraries for state management, routers, server-side rendering, etc. were made.

Yahoo! Mail, Netflix, etc. chose React.

Netflix confirmed the advantages through testing before renovating the site with React.

1. JavaScript code size reduction: Instead of controllers, UI could be implemented declaratively based on state.
2. Gentle learning curve: Similar to JavaScript and HTML syntax.
3. Fast feature addition: Feature addition and builds were faster than existing Java-based apps.

#### Various Libraries

Since React does not aim to be a web development framework, it is used with various libraries.

State Management: Redux, Zustand, Recoil, Jotai

SSR: Next.js, Remix, Hydrogen

Animation: Framer Motion, react-spring, React Move

Charts: Recharts, visx, nivo

Forms: React Hook Form, Formik, React Final Form

#### Direction of React

Utilizing React on the server is the current development direction.

Server components have emerged, and simple APIs can now be created in Next.js.
