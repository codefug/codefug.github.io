A stack is a data structure where the first data entered is taken out last.

# Concept

## LIFO

Last In First Out

The rule where what goes in first comes out last is called Last In First Out or LIFO. The operation of inserting into the stack is called push, and the operation of taking out is called pop.

The operation process is as follows.

Initially, there is an empty stack.

After pushing 1, it exists as follows.

If you push 2 here, it stacks on top as follows.

If you pop here, according to the LIFO method, 2 at the top comes out.

After pushing 3, 3 stacks on top of 1 again.

Finally, if you pop twice in a row, it comes out from the top and returns to the beginning.

## ADT

> [!INFO] ADT
>
> Abstract Data Type
> A data type that only has an interface and is not actually implemented. Think of it as a blueprint for a data type.

A stack must have operations like push, pop, isFull, isEmpty. Also, a variable called top must exist to implement stack operations.

Organizing this into a table looks like this.

| Name    | Definition                     | Description                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isFull  | boolean isFull()               | Check if the stack is full of data                               |
| isEmpty | boolean isEmpty()              | Check if the stack is empty                                      |
| push    | void push(ItemType item)       | Insert data into the stack                                       |
| pop     | ItemType pop()                 | Return the top data of the stack                                 |
| top     | Int top                        | Record the top data of the stack                                 |
| data    | ItemType data`[maxsize]`       | Array that manages the stack, manages up to maxsize data items  |

Based on the table, the ADT looks like this.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Note that -1 is entered in top. top is used as an index of data. When there is one data item, the index is 0, so -1 is used to represent when there is nothing.

When adding data to the stack, it can be expressed as follows.
![](/images/2025-05-31/Pasted%20image%2020250617083445.png)

1. Perform isFull to check if more can be added to the data array
   1. If possible, increase top by 1 and add data to data`[top]`
   2. If not possible, exit

When taking data from the stack, it can be expressed as follows.
![](/images/2025-05-31/Pasted%20image%2020250617083637.png)

1. Perform isEmpty to check if there is data in the data array
   1. If there is, decrease top by 1 and return data`[top+1]`
   2. If there isn't, exit

Now let's implement a stack based on this ADT.

# Implementation

According to the ADT, it can be implemented as follows.

```tsx
class Stack {
  constructor(maxSize) {
    this.data = [];
    this.top = -1;
    this.maxSize = maxSize;
  }
  isFull() {
    return this.top === this.maxSize - 1;
  }

  isEmpty() {
    return this.top === -1;
  }

  push(element) {
    if (this.isFull()) {
      console.log("스택이 가득찼어요");
    } else {
      this.data[this.top++] = element;
    }
  }

  pop() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      console.log("스택이 비어있어요");
    } else {
      return this.data[--this.top];
    }
  }
}
```

Since JavaScript dynamically manages arrays, you can use arrays like stacks without isFull and isEmpty using array methods.

```tsx
const stack = new Array(maxsize);

// push : stack.push(1)
// pop : stack.pop()
// top : stack.length-1
```
